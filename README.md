# Unstructured CFD Solver for 2D Incompressible using .msh(FLUENT) format as Input
Linear Upwind Scheme is used for Convection for better Accuracy <br/>
Used Over Relaxation Approach for better Stability for highly Non-Orthogonal Grids <br/>
Predictor Corrector Method is used for Solving Naviour Stokes Equation using SIMPLE Algorithm <br/>
Results for Test Cases are attached <br/>
1) Aerofoil --> Re = 5000 , Mach = 0.5 ; <br/>
2) Backward Facing Step --> Re = 800 ;   <br/>
3) flow over cylinder --> Re = 100 ;     <br/>
4) Lid Driven Cavity  --> Re = 100 ;     <br/>
